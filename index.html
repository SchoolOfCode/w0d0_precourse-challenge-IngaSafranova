  <p>   Marie Curie (born Maria Salomea Sk≈Çodowska 1867) is remembered for her discovery of radium and polonium, and her huge contribution to finding treatments for cancer. She was the first    woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre          Curie, was a co-winner on her first Nobel Prize, making them the first ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in     1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.<br></br>

  During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.She worked with her daughter Irene at casualty clearing stations close to the front     line, X-raying wounded men to locate fractures, bullets and shrapnel.<br></br>

  After the war, Marie continued her work as a researcher, teacher and head of a laboratory and received many awards and prizes. 
  Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes. In 1920 she founded the Curie Institute in Paris, and in      1932 the Curie Institute in Warsaw; both remain major centres of medical research.
